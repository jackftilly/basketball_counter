This is a simple way to keep score in a pickup basketball game. All you need is somebody on the sideline pressing keys on a laptop and you got your own personal shot statistics. Developed in visual studio 2012, so I don't know how it would work on other compilers. Hope somebody enjoys this fun simple yet effective tool!
If you have an extra player while playing a game of pickup basketball, put them to good use by having them press buttons on your keyboard. This way you will be able to keep an accurate record of points, three pointers, two pointers and field goal percentage, for both individual players and teams. I am currently looking to put this into a windows 10 app for the future.
DIRECTIONS:
  Each key represents a specific value in points to this program.
  There are 10 players in a pickup basketball game, so each numerical key represents one of these players, 0-9.
  The three buttons below and to the right of these keys also represent this player. 
  The numerical key represents "made 3 pointer"
  The key below it, "Q" through "P", represents "missed 3 pointer"
  The key below that, "A" through ";", represents "made 2 pointer";
  The last key on the keyboard, below that last line, "Z" through "/" represents "missed 2 pointer"
  The program is here to count each key as they are pressed, so the user just needs to press the keys as the game goes on.
  You will be asked to input the names of every player, which makes it easier when the stats.txt is filled.
  After the game, go into the stats.txt file and check the numbers. There will be detailed accurate statistics of each player's scoring, and the team scoring.
